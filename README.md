# CorrelateSocialMediaAndStocks

Social media is an increasingly significant aspect of our daily lives; millennials and generation-X especially. As these generations becoming an increasing economic force, it begs the question, does social media play a role in our economy? I seek to find a correlation between  the social media presence of clothing retailers and their stock index.
